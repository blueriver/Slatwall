			<p>
				Slatwall is almost ready for use, but you are missing a datasource.  You have Two Options<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				Option 1) Create a Datasource in your CFIDE or Railo Administrator called: <strong>#this.datasource.name#</strong><br />
				<br />
				Option 2) Add/Edit File: <pre>/custom/config/configApplication.cfm</pre> and add a line of code to define a custom datasource such as: <pre>&lt;cfset this.datasource.name = "MyDatasourceName" /&gt;</pre>
				<br />
				<br />
				If you have created a datasource in CFIDE or Railo that matches <strong>#this.datasource.name#</strong>, then verify that Railo and CFIDE can connect to that datasource.
